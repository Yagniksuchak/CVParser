Preliminary assumptions for detecting section titles in CVs:

-margins and indentation will remain the same for each CV (i.e. won't change between pages)
-section titles won't span multiple lines (unless column format)

for title detection, we'll use a combination of the follow:

-detect indentation
-item followed by a numbered or bulleted list
-UPPERCASE
-font, bold, etc.
-text size
-spacing around the word
-line length


Notes:
-section title with bullet (how is bullet passed to XML, what is the character size, etc.)
-how to detect underline, horizontal rule, etc.
-title could be centered (at least for resumes, possibly less likely for CV)
